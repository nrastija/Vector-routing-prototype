# Vector-Based Route Optimization Prototype

This project explores the use of **vector databases** in optimizing user travel routes using geographic data from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. The core goal is to demonstrate how vector embeddings and similarity-based search can assist in planning efficient and interpretable travel paths between locations. This project is made as part of my **Bachelor's thesis** on the theme of **Vector Databases in Route Optimization**

##  Project Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Data Preparation & Vectorization
- Extract cities and geographic coordinates from OSM data.
- Represent each city as a vector `[longitude, latitude]`.
- Store vectors and metadata in a vector database -- TBD.

### Phase 2: Backend & Search Logic
- Set up a backend API (Python FastAPI or Node.js).
- Perform Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) searches to find nearby cities.
- Simulate route traversal from point A to B using vector chaining.
- Return a detailed route: waypoints, distance, estimated duration.

### Phase 3: Frontend (Optional)

### Phase 4: Testing & Thesis Integration

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case

User inputs two locations. The app retrieves vector representations of each and performs a vector search to return the most efficient travel route, represented as a chain of similar vectors (cities) between A and B.
